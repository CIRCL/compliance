## What personal data do we collect on our website and to which end?

We collect and process your personal data in order to offer our services and provide you, the user, with a safe and comfortable experience when visiting our website. The following paragraphs provide a detailed indication of the personal data we collect and for which specified purposes.

When you are surfing our website, we collect and process web server logs, including IP addresses, user-agents, URLs, date and time logs. We collect those logs for our legitimate interest as these logs enable the technical and functional management of our website. Furthermore, we analyse the data to ensure optimal security of our website.

When you report an incident via the CIRCL report form, we process the reporter’s contact information and any other details of the reported incident (e.g. phishing email headers). We will use these details, if provided, for further case management and to facilitate our ticket system. In that case, we collect personal data for the public interest, to help our constituency handle security incidents (e.g. help with compromised websites).

When you use the URL abuse service, we process the source IP address of the submitter and the submitted URL.

Your public PGP key, should you choose to upload it, is collected and stored on our OpenPGP key server. We use your public PGP key to promote the use of encryption at large, for example in emails and for [the Malware Information Sharing and Threat Intelligence Sharing Platform (MISP)](/misp).

We confirm that we process your personal data in a fair and lawful manner and only for the explicit and legitimate purposes as above-mentioned. At all times, we strive to ensure that your personal data is adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.

## Does our website use cookies?

No, our website does not use any cookies or analytic components.

## How long do we retain your personal data?

In no circumstances, we keep your personal data for a longer period than strictly necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected.

As the retention period is dependent on the purpose for which the personal data were initially collected, the purpose is the criterion that is used to determine the appropriate retention period.

After expiry of the retention period, we strive to securely erase, destroy or anonymize personal data that is no longer required in relation to the purpose for which they were collected.

## Sharing personal data

Your personal data is only processed for internal purposes within CIRCL. We formally confirm that we will not sell, rent or otherwise commercially transfer to or share with a third party the personal data we are collected from our website. However we do share the public PGP key you uploaded in the PGP network, so your public key will be publicly available on our network.

Contact details of the reporter of an incident and all other information related to the incident will not be shared without the reporter’s consent, except if they are required in the scope of a legal investigation. For more information about sharing personal data in the scope of vulnerability disclosure, please refer to [CIRCL’s responsible vulnerability disclosure statement](https://www.circl.lu/pub/responsible-vulnerability-disclosure/) and the [“Confidentiality” section of CIRCL’s guide to report and incident](https://www.circl.lu/report/#confidentiality).

CIRCL actively participates to [Open Data initiatives](/opendata/) in scope to better understand threats and security at large. Information shared in Open Data are pseudo-anonymized, reduced and aggregated in order to limit risk of potential information leak. Nevertheless, if any potential leak is discovered, please [contact us](/contact/).

As our web server is hosted and managed in Luxembourg, your personal data is in no circumstances transferred to third countries outside the EU.

## Security of your personal data

We are striving to keep your personal data secure. To that end, we have adopted the appropriate legal, organizational and technical precautions to prevent any unauthorised access and use of your personal data. These measures include, but are not limited to the encryption of all traffic between our website and your browser.
